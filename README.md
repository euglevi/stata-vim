Vim + Stata
===========

Syntax highlighting and snippets for editing Stata files with vim/neovim.


## Features

* Syntax highlighting for `.do` and `.ado` scripts.
* Syntax highlighting for `.dct` dictionary files (used with `infile`).
* Syntax highlighting for SMCL (Stata help files).
* Snippets for use with [UltiSnips](https://github.com/sirver/ultisnips).

My goal is to be compatible with the latest version of Stata, which is
currently Stata 14.


## Credits

* The main syntax file is mostly the work of [Jeff Pitblado](https://github.com/jpitblado/vim-stata).
* The SMCL syntax file is entirely from [Jeff Pitblado](https://github.com/jpitblado/vim-stata).
